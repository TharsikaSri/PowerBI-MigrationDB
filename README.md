The goal of the Migration project is to clean the data and present the data using visualisations for decision making.

The dataset used is called "Dataset- migration_nz.csv". It consists of a table with details on the arrival and departure, citizenship, country and so on

<div align="center"> <h3 align="center"> 📂 Repository Sections 📂 </h3> </div> 
- Dataset- migration_nz.csv -> a CSV file with the migration dataset <br>
- Migration.pbix - > this is a PowerBI file which contains the visualisations for this project <br> 
- README.md -> this file provides information on this project <br> </div

<div align="center"> <h3 align="center"> 🔑 Key Tools ⚙️ </h3> </div>
Both <b><i> PowerBI </i></b> and <b><i> PowerQuery </i></b> tools were used to successfully complete the analysis. <b><i> Data Cleaning </i></b> was an essential part of this project as the dataset was dirty and it required cleaning before the data visualisation part of the project. Both <b><i> Data Cleaning </i></b> and Data Visualisation processess were completed using <b><i> PowerBI </i></b>.
